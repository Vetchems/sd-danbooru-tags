These are filtered lists of danbooru tags for use with a wildcards script.

Installation:

Option 1:
Drop the txt files into /scripts/wildcards/ to use normal wildcards script.
call a random choice with __dan_hair__ etc

Option 2:
Drop the whole dan folder into scripts/wildcards/ and place the included dynamic prompting script in your scripts folder.
call a random choice with __dan\dan_hair__ etc.


Note: The included script is a slightly modified version of sd-dynamic-prompting, It was from a branch thats since been removed. I am unsure if the functionality exists elsewhere.
